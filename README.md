The code.rar includes all the materials to generate the most results in the above paper, while the rest simply results can be generated by adopting the provided codes. The files in the code.rar are described as follows:

1. The code directory includes two .cpp files (all-or-nothing model.cpp, leaky.cpp), corresponding the two vaccine model used in the above paper, and one .sh file (sample.sh) which is an example of input parameters.

2. The input director includes all the data used in the paper. 
2.1 china_contact-matrix: the 16*16 contact matrix of China population;
2.2 contraindication: the proportion of contraindication and pregnant women by age groups;
2.3 dose: the historical vaccine administration in China;
2.4 population: the shanghai population by age groups;
2.5 susceptibility: the age-specific susceptibility;
2.6 shanghai-contact-matrix: includes 200 bootstrapped contact matrices of Shanghai.
